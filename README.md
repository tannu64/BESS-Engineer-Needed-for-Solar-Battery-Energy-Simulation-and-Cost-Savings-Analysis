- **Simulations to determine:**  
  ‚úÖ Grid consumption reduction using solar & battery  
  ‚úÖ Cost savings from battery discharge during peak hours  
  ‚úÖ Energy yield from solar generation alone  
- **Simulation Scenarios:**  
  - **Scenario 1:** Battery discharges **only from 5 PM ‚Äì 7 PM** and must be **fully discharged by 11 PM**  
  - **Scenario 2:** Battery discharges during peak hours **and** when it **maximizes cost savings**  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **pandas, numpy, matplotlib** for data handling & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook/PyCharm/VS Code** for running simulations

### **Phase I ‚Äì Site A (8 MWp Solar, 16 MWh Battery)**
| **Scenario**  | **Grid Import (kWh)** | **Total Cost (‚Ç¨)** | **Savings (‚Ç¨)** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Baseline** | 46,529.90 | 6,138.16 | --- |
| **Solar Only** | 26,718.87 | 3,153.53 | **2,984.63** |
| **Scenario 1** | 22,333.36 | 2,119.24 | **4,018.92** |
| **Scenario 2** | 43,932.49 | 3,514.60 | **2,623.56** |

### **Phase II ‚Äì Site A + Site B (12.5 MWp Solar, 25 MWh Battery)**
| **Scenario**  | **Grid Import (kWh)** | **Total Cost (‚Ç¨)** | **Savings (‚Ç¨)** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Baseline** | 66,283.52 | 8,732.28 | --- |
| **Solar Only** | 38,216.56 | 4,501.97 | **4,230.31** |
| **Scenario 1** | 31,565.59 | 2,974.87 | **5,757.42** |
| **Scenario 2** | 64,963.75 | 5,197.10 | **3,535.18** |

### **Cost Savings Summary**  
- **Scenario 1 consistently saved more money** by strictly discharging during peak hours (5‚Äì7 PM).  
- **Scenario 2 was more flexible but resulted in higher overall grid import costs.**  
- **Total cost savings from battery operation in Phase II:** **‚Ç¨5,757.42**  

## üìå Key Takeaways  
‚úîÔ∏è **Scenario 1 is the best strategy**‚Äîit saves more money by discharging only during peak hours.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Scenario 2 is more flexible** but incurs **higher costs due to frequent discharges & grid charging inefficiencies.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Phase II saves more money** due to **higher solar PV capacity** and **larger total battery storage.**  

## üöÄ Final Deliverables  
‚úÖ **Simulation Results (Hourly/Half-Hourly)** ‚Äì Load, solar, battery SoC, grid import/export, cost per interval.  
‚úÖ **Summary Tables** ‚Äì Daily, monthly, annual totals of grid consumption, solar contribution, and battery usage.  
‚úÖ **Energy Yield Analysis** ‚Äì kWh offset from solar alone.  
‚úÖ **Battery Utilization Metrics** ‚Äì Number of full cycles, SoC trends.  
‚úÖ **Raw Files** ‚Äì CSV and Python scripts containing time-series data & cost analysis.  
‚úÖ **Recommendations** ‚Äì Insights on optimal battery operation and potential inverter adjustments.  

## üìå Next Steps  
üîπ **Optimize Scenario 2** by implementing a more advanced dispatch logic using **Pyomo** or **PuLP** for optimal cost scheduling.  
üîπ **Include Grid Export Pricing** to analyze potential revenue from solar overgeneration.  
üîπ **Validate the results** with real energy consumption & solar production data from Ireland.

## Upwork Job Description
We, REIN are seeking an experienced Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Engineer to analyze and simulate the performance of a solar + Battery storage system (DC Coupled) for a project. The goal is to optimize energy savings by reducing grid consumption and discharging the battery during peak hours based on the provided tariff structure.
